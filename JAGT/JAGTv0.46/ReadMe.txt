Date Added: 03/18/17
Additions/changes:
*Fixed a text mistake in the circle equation output (the CENTER is h and k, not the point on the circle)
*Circle equation now outputs the radius plus a superscript two and the radius squared
*Fixed several other minor issues that aren't worth noting (mostly because I forgot them :P)
